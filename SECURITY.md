# Security Policy

## 🔒 Web3 Payment Security

### Bank-Level Security Guaranteed

All transactions on this platform are protected with **bullet-proof cryptographic verification signatures**. Every payment is verified on-chain before any transaction executes, ensuring maximum security and transparency.

### Security Features

- **On-Chain Verification**: All transactions are cryptographically verified on the blockchain before execution
- **Bullet-Proof Signatures**: Every payment requires cryptographic signature verification
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Secure transactions across Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism
- **No Transaction Without Verification**: No transaction proceeds without full cryptographic verification
- **100% Transparent**: All transactions are publicly verifiable on-chain
- **Transaction Tracking**: Each transaction hash is stored and tracked to prevent duplicate downloads

### Payment Security Measures

1. **Wallet Signature Required**: Users must sign a message authorizing the transaction
2. **On-Chain Verification**: Transactions are verified on-chain before any action is taken
3. **Transaction Hash Tracking**: Resume downloads are tied to specific transaction hashes to prevent abuse
4. **LocalStorage Protection**: Transaction hashes are stored locally to prevent multiple downloads from the same payment
5. **Real-Time Price Conversion**: ETH prices are fetched from CoinGecko API for accurate conversion

### Supported Networks

- **Ethereum Mainnet** (Chain ID: 1)
- **Base** (Chain ID: 8453)
- **Polygon** (Chain ID: 137)
- **Arbitrum** (Chain ID: 42161)
- **Optimism** (Chain ID: 10)

> **Note**: Testnet support has been removed. Only mainnet chains are supported for production use.

### Best Practices for Users

- Always verify the recipient address before sending transactions
- Double-check transaction details in your wallet before confirming
- Keep your wallet software and browser extensions updated
- Never share your private keys or seed phrases
- Verify transaction hashes on block explorers after completion
