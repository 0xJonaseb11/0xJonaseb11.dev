## Support My Work

[![Send Real ETH](https://img.shields.io/badge/Support%20the%20build-Send%20ETH-9333EA?style=for-the-badge&logo=ethereum&logoColor=white)](https://0xjonaseb11.vercel.app/#support-my-work)

- Back the studio directly from the live site and unlock an on-chain supporter badge instantly.
- Every successful transaction now triggers a personal email alert so I can thank you faster.
- ETH, USDT, and badge download links are surfaced post-transaction, making bragging rights easy.
- Prefer sharing? Social buttons auto-compose LinkedIn, X, and WhatsApp shoutouts.
- Leave your email right after the transaction so I can respond with a tailored thank-you.

### Paid Resume Access

- `$0.50 USDT` per download, auto-converted to the live ETH rate via CoinGecko.
- Wallet signature + on-chain payment are required before the PDF link unlocks.
- Works across every supported chain (Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Mainnet).
- Prevents free riding by fetching the PDF through a signed, post-transaction fetch.

### 🔒 Security & Trust

**Bank-Level Security Guaranteed**: All transactions on this platform are protected with bullet-proof cryptographic verification signatures. Every payment is verified on-chain before any transaction executes, ensuring maximum security and transparency. Your payment is cryptographically verified—no transaction proceeds without full verification. **100% secure, 100% transparent.**
